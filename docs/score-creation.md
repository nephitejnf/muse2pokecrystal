# Creating a MusicXML Score

There is a lot of software out there that already supports exporting to MusicXML.
You may use some already, you don't need to just use MuseScore to do it.
If you wanna see what you have that may support it [this list](https://www.musicxml.com/software/) is a good place to start.

If you have never messed with music software, then you might try something like [flat.io](https://flat.io/) to start out.
It is a piece online music notation software that doesn't require you installing anything.
It allows you to export to MusicXML which you can then process through the script.
